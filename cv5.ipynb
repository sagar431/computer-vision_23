    "Each of these parameters can be fine-tuned through various techniques and methods. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of hidden layers: This can be fine-tuned through trial and error, gradually adding or removing layers to find the optimal balance between model complexity and performance.\n",
    "- Network architecture: The network architecture can be fine-tuned by exploring different architectures, such as residual networks, dense networks, or attention-based networks. This can be done through manual tuning or through automated search techniques like Neural Architecture Search (NAS).\n",
    "- Each layer's number of neurons: This can be fine-tuned through manual tuning or through techniques like grid search or random search to find the optimal number of neurons for each layer.\n",
    "- Form of activation: Different activation functions can be tested to find the optimal one for the given problem, such as ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh.\n",
    "- Optimization and learning: Different optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, or RMSprop, can be used to find the optimal one for the given problem.\n",
    "- Learning rate and decay schedule: The learning rate and decay schedule can be fine-tuned by adjusting the learning rate and the decay rate during training. This can be done through manual tuning or through automated techniques like learning rate schedulers.\n",
    "- Mini batch size: The mini-batch size can be fine-tuned by testing different batch sizes and evaluating the performance of the model.\n",
    "- Algorithms for optimization: Different optimization algorithms like L-BFGS or conjugate gradient can be tested to find the optimal one for the given problem.\n",
    "- The number of epochs: The number of epochs can be fine-tuned by testing different values and evaluating the performance of the model. Early stopping criteria can also be used to stop training when the performance of the model starts to degrade.\n",
    "- Regularization techniques: Regularization techniques like L2 normalization or dropout layers can be used to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance.\n",
    "- Data augmentation: Data augmentation techniques like image flipping, rotation, or scaling can be used to increase the amount of training data and improve the performance of the model."
